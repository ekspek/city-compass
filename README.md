# City Compass

Lua script to create a compass for a specific coordinate that gives the distance to other major (or specific) waypoints from that coordinate aside from the four major cardinal directions.

The current idea is to give the input data (cities and other waypoints) via a .csv document, using the WGS84 reference to perform the calculations, and make a LuaLaTeX document that uses the code to make a simple, ugly TikZ-based compass printout as an example.
